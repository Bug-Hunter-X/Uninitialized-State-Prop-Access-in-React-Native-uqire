This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized in a React Native component.  This often happens inside the component's render method or other lifecycle methods that execute before the state has had a chance to be set.

```javascript
// Incorrect - accessing state before it's ready
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Text>{this.state.someValue}</Text> // Error here if someValue isn't set yet
    );
  }
}
```
